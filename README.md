## Bottom Line Up Front:
- This is (going to be) a curated selection of technical notes from my Obsidian vault
- As it currently stands, this repository will be a smattering of random technical guides and commands I've found useful

## Etc etc etc...
- These guides are going to be pretty topical and pragmatic - I wouldn't expect to see anything earth shattering in these guides if you've been around the block
- If you're new to IT, cybersecurity, or a little rusty, maybe you'll find my direct and blunt writing style to be helpful. I hope you do
