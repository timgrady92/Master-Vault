# nmtui

**Base Operating System:**

- Red Hat Enterprise Linux

**Terminal Type:**
  
- Any

**Main Purpose of Command:**
- Provide a GUI for network administration
- Allows a privileged user to change IP addresses, network adapters, and more

**Personal Note:**

- This method of changing network configurations is leagues easier than using "nmcli" or otherwise
- Yeah, it's great to be a cli wizard, but sometimes you just need two boxes to connect; that's where nmtui shines

**Examples:**
```
sudo nmtui
```
